### Boilerplate code to publish your custom React hooks as fast as possible :rocket:

- Fork the repository
- start creating and writing your hooks inside `./src/hooks/`
- then export them from `./src/hooks/index.ts`
- configure `package.json` , `.npmignore` , `.gitignore` 
- run `npm run build`
- run  `npm publish`
- now your package is published to [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)
